2. Open one terminal window and cd to workspace/414_A5/bin, run command "rmiregistry 2500 &" ,
   keep this terminal window open. 
   In another terminal window, cd to workspace/414_A5/src, run
   "javac server/*.java", and then run "java server.GameServer #_of_players", #_of_players is
   an integer between 2 and 4.
   Depend on the number of players entered eariler, open the corresponding number of terminal
   windows, and in those windows cd to workspace/414_A5/src, and run "javac client/*.java", then
   run "java client.GameClient". This will open the pop up window for each player to enter their

   be improved. Model view seperation is strong with this assignment, we had ahead start in A4,
   and have always paied attention to it.

5. Model View Controller, and Broker pattern is used for the code design. 
   Componentization, extract class, and extract method were used to refactoring
